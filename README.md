My Story
-
In 2011, I decided to study Finance and become an accountant / financial advisor. I started my journey with accountability until I discovered Microsoft Access then everything changed! I dropped all my courses and changed my major to Information Technology and Computing.

And Here we go! I worked on a lot of projects (mainly websites) using content management systems such as Drupal 7,8,9 and Wordpress. I also worked on combining between Drupal and Atomic Design systems such as Pattern Lab.

My resolution is to refine my coding skills until I become a succefull Full Stach Web Developer
